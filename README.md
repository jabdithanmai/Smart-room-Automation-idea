# Smart-room-Automation-ideas
Designing of automation implementation ideas for a room containing an AC, fan, lights and a fire alert system.

## Design Approach
Potential areas for automation within the room considering the Energy efficiency,User convenience and Safety enhancements are:
The design approach concentrates on creating an intelligent automation system for a room including various components like AC, fan, lights and a fire alert system to enhance efficiency and convenience, reduce carbon footprint, and increase safety through automation.
**Central Hub:** A central hub such as Nodemcu ESP8266 which manages and integrates all devices.
**Individual subsystems:** These subsystems include based on the taken requirements.
 **Sensors:**  The sensors collect data like temperature like RTD's and NTC Thermistors.
**Interfaces:** voice controlled commands and mobile apps can be used.
